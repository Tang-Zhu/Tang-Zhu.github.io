<p><strong>Stress</strong> is the distribution of internal forces per unit area within a material, usually represented by the symbol $\sigma$. The unit of stress is Pascal ($Pa$), which is equal to Newton per square meter ($N/m^{2}$). The equation for stress can be expressed as</p>
<p>$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$</p>
<p>where $F$ represents the force applied to the object in Newtons ($N$) or kilonewtons ($kN$) and $A$ represents the area of the object subjected to the force in square meters ($m^{2}$) or square centimeters ($cm^{2}$).</p>
<p>Stress is a measure of the deformation or strain that occurs in a material when subjected to external forces. In materials science and engineering, stress is an important parameter used for designing and analyzing the strength and stability of various structures and mechanical components.</p>
<p>There are different types of stress, including tensile stress, compressive stress, and shear stress. Tensile stress is the stress that occurs in a material when it is pulled or stretched, while compressive stress is the stress that occurs when it is compressed or squeezed. Shear stress is the stress that results from the relative sliding between the molecular planes of a material, commonly observed in cutting operations and shearing forces.</p>
<p>The magnitude and direction of stress have significant effects on the strength and deformation of a material. If the stress exceeds the ultimate strength of a material, it will fail or break. Therefore, stress analysis is a critical part of engineering design to ensure the safety and reliability of structures and mechanical components.</p>

<p><strong>Stress tensor</strong> is a mathematical object used to describe the state of stress to which a solid is subjected internally. It is a second-order tensor containing nine components representing the positive and shear stresses in three coordinate directions. In three-dimensional space, the stress tensor can be represented as a $3\times3$ matrix as follows</p>
<p>$$
\epsilon =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{xx} &amp; sigma_{xy} &amp; sigma_{xz} \
\sigma_{yx} &amp; sigma_{yy} &amp; sigma_{yz} \
\sigma_{zx} &amp; sigma_{zy} &amp; sigma_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>where $\sigma_{ij}$ indicates that the stress component in the $i$-th coordinate direction is caused by the stress in the $j$-th coordinate direction. The symmetry of the stress tensor indicates the equilibrium of the forces, i.e., the sum of the tangential stresses in any plane is zero.</p>
<p>In two dimensions, the stress tensor is represented by a $2\times2$ symmetric matrix, and its components are denoted by $\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$, $\sigma_{xy}$, and $\sigma_{yx}$.</p>
<p>The stress tensor in two dimensions can be written as:</p>
<p>$$
\epsilon =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{xx} &amp; sigma_{xy} \
\sigma_{yx} &amp; sigma_{yy} \
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>where $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{yy}$ are the normal stresses acting on the $x$ and y planes, respectively, $\sigma_{xy}$, and $\sigma_{yx}$ is the shear stress acting on the $xy$ plane.</p>
<p>The stress tensor can be solved by applying an external force to an object and then measuring the stress inside the object. It is an important concept in the fields of elastodynamics, mechanics of materials, solid mechanics, and fluid mechanics. The stress tensor can also be used to calculate the strain tensor, which describes the deformation within a solid.</p>

<p><strong>Strain</strong> is the degree of deformation of an object under the action of an external force and is usually expressed as ε. Strain can be divided into different types, including linear strain, shear strain, and volume strain, etc. Each type of strain has different calculation formulae.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Linear or axial strain</strong>
Linear strain refers to the degree of deformation of an object when it is stretched or compressed in a certain direction. The formula for calculating linear strain is</p>
<p>$$ \epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_{0}}$$</p>
<p>where $\epsilon$ represents the linear strain, $\Delta L$ represents the amount of change in the length of the object, and $L_{0}$ represents the original length of the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shear strain</strong>
Shear strain is the degree of deformation that occurs when an object is subjected to a cutting force. The formula for calculating shear strain is</p>
<p>$$\gamma = \frac{\Delta x}{h}$$</p>
<p>where $\gamma$ is the shear strain, $\Delta x$ is the displacement of the object shear, and $h$ is the thickness of the object shear surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Volumetric strain</strong>
Volumetric strain is the degree of change in the overall volume of an object when subjected to an external force. The formula for calculating the volumetric strain is</p>
<p>$$ \epsilon_{v} = \frac{\Delta V}{V_{0}}$$</p>
<p>where $\epsilon_{v}$ denotes the volume strain, $\Delta V$ denotes the amount of change in the volume of the object, and $V_{0}$ denotes the original volume of the object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The appropriate strain formula needs to be selected for the calculation according to the specific type of strain and the deformation of the object. Different types of strains have different importance and uses in different mechanical and engineering applications.</p>

<p><strong>Strain tensor</strong> is a mathematical object that describes the deformation of a solid body in response to an applied stress. It is a second-order tensor, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.</p>
<p>The strain tensor is defined as the relative change in length between two infinitesimally close points within the body in response to an applied stress. It can be expressed as a matrix of six components in three dimensions, or as a vector in two dimensions.</p>
<p>In three dimensions, the strain tensor can be represented as:</p>
<p>$$
\epsilon =
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{xx} &amp; epsilon_{xy} &amp; epsilon_{xz} \
\epsilon_{yx} &amp; epsilon_{yy} &amp; epsilon_{yz} \
\epsilon_{zx} &amp; epsilon_{zy} &amp; epsilon_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>where $\epsilon_{ij}$ represents the strain in the $i-th$ direction caused by a stress in the $j-th$ direction.</p>
<p>In two dimensions, the strain tensor can be represented as:
$$
\epsilon =
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{xx} &amp; epsilon_{xy} \
\epsilon_{yx} &amp; epsilon_{yy} \
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $\epsilon_{xx}$ and $\epsilon_{yy}$ represent the strains in the $x$- and $y$-directions, respectively, $\epsilon_{xy}$ and $\epsilon_{yx}$ represents the shear strain.</p>
<p>The strain tensor is an important quantity in solid mechanics, as it is used to calculate the stress tensor, which describes the distribution of stresses within the body. The strain tensor can also be used to calculate other mechanical properties of the material, such as the elastic modulus and Poisson&rsquo;s ratio.</p>

</h2>
<p>**Strain energy **is the energy stored inside an object due to stress. Under stress, an object is deformed, which leads to the accumulation of deformation energy inside the object. Strain energy is usually expressed in mathematical form as the volume integral of an object, and it is an important parameter to describe the elastic behavior of an object.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the strain energy depends on the shape and size of the object, the material properties and the force applied to the object. When the applied force exceeds the elastic limit of the object, the strain energy will be released, resulting in plastic deformation or destruction of the object. Therefore, strain energy is an important indicator to assess whether an object has sufficient strength and stability under force.</p>
<p>In engineering design and structural optimization, strain energy is often used as a design objective or optimization indicator. For example, when designing automotive structures, strain energy can be used to optimize the stiffness and weight of a vehicle frame. When designing mechanical parts, strain energy can be used to optimize the material use and weight reduction of the part. By optimizing strain energy, more efficient, reliable and economical designs can be achieved.</p>

<p><strong>Elastic deformation</strong> refers to the reversible deformation of a material when subjected to stress. That is, when external forces are removed, the object can return to its original shape. Elastic deformation typically occurs when the applied stress is below the elastic limit of the material.</p>
<p><strong>Plastic deformation</strong> refers to the irreversible deformation of a material when subjected to stress. Unlike elastic deformation, plastic deformation does not return to its original shape when the external forces are removed. Plastic deformation typically occurs when the applied stress exceeds the elastic limit of the material. When a material is subjected to sufficiently large stresses, the atoms or molecules within it will begin to move and deform until they reach a new equilibrium position. This results in permanent changes to the shape and volume of the material.</p>

<p><strong>Small strain linear elasticity</strong> is a branch of continuum mechanics that deals with the behavior of materials under small deformations or strains. In this framework, it is assumed that the deformation is sufficiently small such that the relationship between stress and strain can be approximated as linear, meaning that the deformation is proportional to the applied stress and returns to its original shape when the stress is removed. This linear relationship is described by Hooke&rsquo;s law, which states that the stress is proportional to the strain.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as $\sigma  = C \epsilon$, where $\sigma$ is the stress tensor, $\epsilon$ is the strain tensor, and $C$ is the fourth-order elastic stiffness tensor. The stiffness tensor contains information about the material properties and can be determined experimentally or theoretically.</p>
<p>The small strain assumption means that the magnitude of the deformation is much smaller than the size of the object being deformed. This assumption allows for simplifications in mathematical computations and is valid for most engineering applications, including the design of structures and machines, the analysis of geological formations, and the development of new materials. It is an important tool for understanding the mechanical behavior of materials and predicting their response to external loads.</p>

<p><strong>Elastic modulus</strong> is a measure of the stiffness or elasticity of a material, usually denoted by the symbol $E$. Elastic modulus is given by</p>
<p>$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$$</p>
<p>where E denotes the modulus of elasticity in pascals ($Pa$) or kilopascals ($kPa$); $\sigma$ denotes the stress in pascals; and $\epsilon$ denotes the strain, unitless.</p>
<p>Elastic modulus is the ratio of the elastic deformation of a material to the area subjected to an external force. It is the ratio of the degree of elastic deformation produced by a material when subjected to an external force to the area subjected to the force, and can also be expressed as the amount of elastic energy stored per unit volume. The higher the modulus of elasticity, the more difficult it is for the material to deform or distort, and the higher the stiffness.</p>
<p>Elastic modulus is commonly used to describe the elastic properties of various materials, including solids, liquids and gases. In solid materials, the modulus of elasticity can be used to calculate the relationship between stress and strain when a material is subjected to a force. It is an important parameter for the elastic behavior of materials and is of great importance for engineering design and material selection.</p>
<p>Elastic modulus of different materials can vary greatly, for example, the modulus of elasticity of steel is about $2.1\times10^{11} Pa$, the modulus of elasticity of aluminum is about $7\times10^{10} Pa$, and the modulus of elasticity of rubber is only about a few million $Pa$.</p>
<p>Elastic modulus can be measured by various experimental methods, such as tensile test, compression test and bending test. In engineering design, elastic modulus is often used to calculate and predict the deformation and damage behavior of materials under different loads to ensure that the designed structures and materials will meet the expected usage requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Strain energy density</strong> is a measure of the amount of energy stored within a material per unit volume due to its deformation or strain. When a material is subjected to external forces, it undergoes deformation, and some of the energy of the system is stored within the material in the form of strain energy.</p>
<p>The strain energy density is represented by the symbol $u$ (sometimes also denoted by $W$) and is typically expressed in units of joules per cubic meter ($J/m^{3}$). It is calculated by dividing the strain energy of a material by its volume. The equation for the strain energy density is</p>
<p>$$u = \frac{1}{2} \times σ \times ε = \frac{1}{2} \times (E \times \epsilon^{2}) $$</p>
<p>σ denotes the stress in pascals ($Pa$); and $\epsilon$ denotes the strain, unitless, and $E$ denotes the modulus of elasticity of the object. The $\frac{1}{2}$ in the formula is because the elastic potential energy is generated by the deformation in both directions, tensile and compressive, which are equal and therefore need to be averaged.</p>
<p>Strain energy density plays an important role in determining the mechanical properties of materials, such as their stiffness, strength, and toughness. It is often used in engineering applications to design and analyze the behavior of materials under different loading conditions.</p>
<p>For example, in the design of a spring, the strain energy density is a key factor in determining the amount of deformation that the spring can undergo before reaching its maximum load capacity. By calculating the strain energy density, engineers can optimize the design of the spring to achieve the desired level of performance and reliability.</p>

<p><strong>Elastic modulus</strong> and <strong>strain energy density</strong> are both important parameters in the mechanics of materials, but they describe different material properties.</p>
<p>Elastic modulus (also known as the coefficient of elasticity) is a measure of the stiffness or elasticity of a material and is usually denoted by the symbol E. It is the ratio of the degree of elastic deformation produced by a material when subjected to an external force to the area subjected to the force, and can also be expressed as the amount of elastic energy stored per unit volume. The greater the modulus of elasticity, the more difficult it is for the material to deform or distort, and the higher the stiffness. The unit of modulus of elasticity is Pascal ($Pa$) or kilopascal ($kPa$).</p>
<p>Strain energy density is the density of energy stored in the material during deformation, usually expressed by the symbol u. It is the ratio of strain energy to volume of the material in joules per cubic meter ($J/m^{3}$). When a material is subjected to an external force, it deforms and this deformation stores energy, which is recovered in the form of strain energy density to describe the process when the external force stops acting on the material. Strain energy density can be used to predict properties such as stability and strength of a material during deformation.</p>
<p>Although both elastic modulus and strain energy density describe the mechanical properties of a material, they describe slightly different aspects. Elastic modulus is more concerned with the stiffness and elastic properties of a material, while strain energy density is more concerned with the energy storage and release properties of a material.</p>

<p><strong>Lamé parameters</strong>, also known as Lamé coefficients, are two material constants that describe the elastic properties of a solid material. They are named after the French mathematician Gabriel Lamé who introduced them in the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>The two Lamé parameters are denoted by $\lambda$ and $\mu$, where $\lambda$ is the first Lamé parameter (also known as the &ldquo;Lamé constant&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lamé modulus&rdquo;) and $\mu$ is the second Lamé parameter (also known as the &ldquo;shear modulus&rdquo; or &ldquo;rigidity modulus&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In terms of these parameters, the stress tensor can be expressed as a function of the strain tensor using the linear elasticity equations. Specifically, for a linear elastic material, the stress tensor $\sigma$ is related to the strain tensor $\epsilon$ by the equation:</p>
<p>$$\sigma = \lambda tr(\epsilon) I + 2\mu\epsilon$$</p>
<p>where $tr(\epsilon)$ is the trace of the strain tensor (the sum of its diagonal elements), $I$ is the identity matrix, and $\epsilon$ is the strain tensor.</p>
<p>The Lamé parameters are important in the study of elasticity, plasticity, and deformation of solids, and are used to characterize the mechanical behavior of materials under various loading conditions. They are typically determined experimentally and can vary significantly depending on the material composition and structure.</p>
