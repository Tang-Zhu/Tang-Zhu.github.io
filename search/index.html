//c++20 #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; //early version preprocessor directives c++20 uses #pragma once to instead of #ifndef...#endif to avoid re-importing the same module.\n//c++20 #pragma once //... codes //early version #ifndef mycode #define mycode //..codes #endif nested namesapce a nested namespace is a namespace inside another one. each namespace is separated by a double colon. here the difference after and before c++17\n//after c++17 namespace mylibraries::networking::ftp { /* ... */ } //early version namespace mylibraries { namespace networking { namespace ftp { /* ... */ } } } namespace alias a namespace alias can be used to give a new and possibly shorter name to another namespace. here’s an example:\nnamespace myftp = mylibraries::networking::ftp; numeric literals digits separators can be used in numeric literals. a digits separator is a single quote character. for example:\n23\u0026#39;456\u0026#39;789 0.123\u0026#39;456f variables uniform initialization '{}' was introduced with the c++11 standard instead of using assignment synatx '='.\nint v {7}; //c++11 int v = 7; //early version c++20 provides char8_t, char16_t, char32_t to represent a single n-bit utf-n-encoded unicode character where n can be 8, 16, or 32.\n*before c++20 wchar_t was used to process unicode character.\n//c++ char8_t c8 {u8\u0026#39;m\u0026#39;};

(the detailed differences will be introduced in the follow chapter.) var x = 1; let y = \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;; const z = [1, \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;]; operator javascript use arithmetic operators (+ - * /) and assigning operators (=) same like math method.\nvar x == (x + y) * 10; javascript also have bitwise operator, condition operator, comparison operator and logical operator, which will be introduced in the follow chapter.\nsyntax javascript use ; to separate different statement.\nx = 5 + 6; y = x * 10; function javascript use keyword \u0026ldquo;function\u0026rdquo; to define a function.\nfunction myfunction(a, b) { return a * b; } keyword javascript keep a lot of keywords for build-in functions, which can not be used as custom element.\nabstract else instanceof super boolean enum int switch break export interface synchronized byte extends let this case false long throw catch final native throws char finally new transient class float null true const for package try continue function private typeof debugger goto protected var default if public void delete implements return volatile do import short while double in static with comments javascript use double slash (// ) as the single line comments mark, and use (/* */) as the multiple lines comments mark.\n// this is the single line comments, which will not be considered as codes. /* this is the multiple lines comments mark */ coding javascript is case-sensitive and uses the unicode character set, which means it can supports such like:\nconst früh = \u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34;; variable variable is a container for mutable values or expressions.\nnaming rule the name of variable observed follow rules:\nsupport number, alphabet, $, and _. must start with alphabet or $ or _. support unicode character set. case-sensitive. var x = 5;

var x = new number; var declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value. var x = 1; if (x === 1) { var x = 2; // if use \u0026#39;let\u0026#39; the second output is 1 console.log(x);

try { number = 99; // if add \u0026#39;const\u0026#39;, it can be accepted and value is 99 } catch (err) { console.log(err); // expected output: typeerror: invalid assignment to const `number\u0026#39; // (note: the exact output may be browser-dependent) } console.log(number); // expected output: 42 you can declare variables to unpack values using the destructuring assignment syntax. for example:\nconst { bar } = foo this will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.\nvariables should always be declared before they are used. javascript used to allow assigning to undeclared variables, which creates an undeclared global variable. this is an error in strict mode and should be avoided altogether.\ninitialization in var and let declarations, the initializer is optional. if a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value undefined.\nlet x; console.log(x); // logs \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34; const declarations always need an initializer, because they forbid any kind of assignment after declaration, and implicitly initializing it with undefined is likely a programmer mistake.\nconst x; // syntaxerror: missing initializer in const declaration variable scope a variable may belong to one of the following scopes:\nglobal scope: the default scope for all code running in script mode. module scope: the scope for code running in module mode. function scope: the scope created with a function. in addition, variables declared with let or const can belong to an additional scope:\nblock scope: the scope created with a pair of curly braces ({}). variable hoisting var declared variables are hoisted, meaning you can refer to the variable anywhere in its scope, even if its declaration isn\u0026rsquo;t reached yet. you can see var declarations as being \u0026ldquo;lifted\u0026rdquo; to the top of its function or global scope. however, if you access a variable before it\u0026rsquo;s declared, the value is always undefined, because only its declaration is hoisted, but not its initialization.\nconsole.log(x === undefined); // true var x = 3; (function() { console.log(x); // undefined var x = \u0026#39;local value\u0026#39;; })(); the above examples will be interpreted the same as:\nvar x; console.log(x === undefined); // true x = 3; (function() { var x; console.log(x); // undefined x = \u0026#39;local value\u0026#39;; })(); notice if remove the sceond var in the first example, it will be:\nconsole.log(x === undefined); // true var x = 3; (function() { console.log(x); // 3 // because no new decalaration to be hoisted x = \u0026#39;local value\u0026#39;; })(); because of hoisting, all var statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the function as possible. this best practice increases the clarity of the code.\nbecause the variable is in a \u0026ldquo;temporal dead zone\u0026rdquo; from the start of the block until the declaration is processed, same situation for let and const will cause referenceerror.\nconsole.log(x); // referenceerror const x = 3; console.log(y); // referenceerror let y = 3; unlike var declarations, which only hoist the declaration but not its value, function declarations are hoisted entirely — you can safely call the function anywhere in its scope.\nundeclared variables if you try to use a variable without declaration under nonstrict-model, this value will belong to \u0026ldquo;window\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo;s a property to be accessed.\nvar var1 = 1; // unable to change var2 = 2; // belong to \u0026#39;window\u0026#39; can be changed console.log(this.var1); // 1 console.log(window.var1); // 1 console.log(window.var2); // 2 delete var1; // false can not be deleted console.log(var1); // 1 delete var2; console.log(delete var2); // true console.log(var2); // deleted, error: undefined constants you cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. for example:\n// this will cause an error function f() {}; const f = 5; // this will cause an error too function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements } however, const only prevents re-assignments, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t prevent mutations. the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.\nconst my_object = { key: \u0026#39;value\u0026#39; }; my_object.key = \u0026#39;othervalue\u0026#39;; also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.\nconst my_array = [\u0026#39;html\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;css\u0026#39;]; my_array.push(\u0026#39;javascript\u0026#39;); console.log(my_array); // [\u0026#39;html\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;css\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;javascript\u0026#39;]; data type javascript data type can be divided into two types: primitive and object.\nprimitive boolean, null, undefined, number, string, symbol object array, object, function, date, regex javascript have dynamic types, which means same variable can represent different data type.\nvar x; // undefined var x = 5; // number var x = \u0026#34;john\u0026#34;; // string it can use typeof to check the variable data type.\ntypeof \u0026#34;john\u0026#34; // return string typeof 3.14 // return number typeof false // return boolean typeof [1,2,3,4] // return object typeof {name:\u0026#39;john\u0026#39;, age:34} // return object string string is used to contain character set. the mark is \u0026quot;

number javascript have three ways to represent number.\ninteger without decimal point. decimal with decimal point, which integer part can be omitted. scientific notation with exponent (e or e). var x = 1; var y = 3.14; var m = .325; // 0.325 var n = 498e-4; // 0.0498 boolean boolean is a logical variable only support two values: true of false.\nvar flag = true; var mark = false; array array is used to contain a set of values, and the types of these values can be different. array, in fact, has two different means: array object and array literal.\nfor array object, you can create it by:\nvar arr = new array(); arr[0] = \u0026#34;kiona\u0026#34;; arr[1] = 1; arr[2] = true; or use condensed way:\nvar arr = new arry(\u0026#34;kiona\u0026#34;, 1, true); for array literal, it is easy to create:\nvar arr = [\u0026#34;kiona\u0026#34;, 1, true]; arry will be discussed later for details.\nobject an object has its key and corresponding value, format is (key : value).\nvar person={name:\u0026#34;kiona\u0026#34;, age:25, sex:male}; there are two ways to access these properties:\nvar name = person.name; var age = person[\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;]; object will be discussed later for details.\nundefined and null undefined means the variable has not been assigned value. but null means the value is null.\nvar x; // x is undefined x = null; // x is null now object for javascript almost every can be seen as object. an object has its key and corresponding value, format is (key : value). the mainly difference between variable and object is variable only has one value, but object can have arbitrary properties include their values.\nvar v1 = 163; // variabel var car = {brand:\u0026#34;toyota\u0026#34;, price:25e10, color:\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;}; // object it can be said object is a container of variable, but this variable observed format key : value called as property.\nthere are two ways to access property:\nvar car = {brand:\u0026#34;toyota\u0026#34;, price:25e10, color:\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;}; var brand = car.brand; var age = car[\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;]; another difference is function can be a member for object as property. you can use object.function() to access it, but if you omit \u0026ldquo;()\u0026rdquo;, it will print the code directly.\nvar obj = { myfunction : function(){ return \u0026#34;kiona\u0026#34;; } } console.log(obj.myfunction()); // kiona console.log(obj.myfunction); // function(){ return \u0026#34;kiona\u0026#34;; } function function is a code block which can be reused anytime. the grammar for defining a function is as follow, the argument and return are not necessary, or you can just return without value:\nfunction functionname(argument1, argument2,..., argumentn) { // code return result; } the real values must strictly ordered same as the order of arguments, when call the function.\nfunction add(x, y){ return x + y; } console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3 local variable the space between double {} of function called local space. when define variable inside local space by var, the life of this variable will end with the end of the function.\nfunction print(){ var str = \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;; return str; } console.log(str); // error: str is undefined console.log(print()); // hello global variable on the contrary, global space means space outside the function. global variable can be accessed anytime untill the program end.\nvar str = \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;;

if (x === 1) { let x = 2; /* if use var, it will result clash because of * existing global \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; and local \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; */ console.log(x); // expected output: 2 } console.log(x); // expected output: 1 const creates block-scoped constants, much like variables declared using the let keyword. the value of a constant can\u0026rsquo;t be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can\u0026rsquo;t be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration). however, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed. const number = 42; try { number = 99; // if add \u0026#39;const\u0026#39;, it can be accepted and value is 99 } catch (err) { console.log(err); // expected output: typeerror: invalid assignment to const `number\u0026#39; // (note: the exact output may be browser-dependent) } console.log(number); // expected output: 42 you can declare variables to unpack values using the destructuring assignment syntax. for example:\nconst { bar } = foo this will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.\nvariables should always be declared before they are used. javascript used to allow assigning to undeclared variables, which creates an undeclared global variable. this is an error in strict mode and should be avoided altogether.\ninitialization in var and let declarations, the initializer is optional. if a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value undefined.\nlet x; console.log(x); // logs \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34; const declarations always need an initializer, because they forbid any kind of assignment after declaration, and implicitly initializing it with undefined is likely a programmer mistake.\nconst x; // syntaxerror: missing initializer in const declaration variable scope a variable may belong to one of the following scopes:\nglobal scope: the default scope for all code running in script mode. module scope: the scope for code running in module mode. function scope: the scope created with a function. in addition, variables declared with let or const can belong to an additional scope:\nblock scope: the scope created with a pair of curly braces ({}). variable hoisting var declared variables are hoisted, meaning you can refer to the variable anywhere in its scope, even if its declaration isn\u0026rsquo;t reached yet. you can see var declarations as being \u0026ldquo;lifted\u0026rdquo; to the top of its function or global scope. however, if you access a variable before it\u0026rsquo;s declared, the value is always undefined, because only its declaration is hoisted, but not its initialization.\nconsole.log(x === undefined); // true var x = 3; (function() { console.log(x); // undefined var x = \u0026#39;local value\u0026#39;; })(); the above examples will be interpreted the same as:\nvar x; console.log(x === undefined); // true x = 3; (function() { var x; console.log(x); // undefined x = \u0026#39;local value\u0026#39;; })(); notice if remove the sceond var in the first example, it will be:\nconsole.log(x === undefined); // true var x = 3; (function() { console.log(x); // 3 // because no new decalaration to be hoisted x = \u0026#39;local value\u0026#39;; })(); because of hoisting, all var statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the function as possible. this best practice increases the clarity of the code.\nbecause the variable is in a \u0026ldquo;temporal dead zone\u0026rdquo; from the start of the block until the declaration is processed, same situation for let and const will cause referenceerror.\nconsole.log(x); // referenceerror const x = 3; console.log(y); // referenceerror let y = 3; unlike var declarations, which only hoist the declaration but not its value, function declarations are hoisted entirely — you can safely call the function anywhere in its scope.\nglobal variables global variables are in fact properties of the global object.\nin web pages, the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax. in all environments, you can use the globalthis variable (which itself is a global variable) to access global variables.\nconsequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name.\nconstants you cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. for example:\n// this will cause an error function f() {}; const f = 5; // this will cause an error too function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements } however, const only prevents re-assignments, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t prevent mutations. the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.\nconst my_object = { key: \u0026#39;value\u0026#39; }; my_object.key = \u0026#39;othervalue\u0026#39;; also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.\nconst my_array = [\u0026#39;html\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;css\u0026#39;]; my_array.push(\u0026#39;javascript\u0026#39;); console.log(my_array); // [\u0026#39;html\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;css\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;javascript\u0026#39;]; data types the latest ecmascript standard defines eight data types:\nseven data types that are primitives:\nboolean. true and false. null. a special keyword denoting a null value. (because javascript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as null, null, or any other variant.) undefined. a top-level property whose value is not defined. number. an integer or floating point number. for example: 42 or 3.14159. bigint. an integer with arbitrary precision. for example: 9007199254740992n. string. a sequence of characters that represent a text value. for example: \u0026ldquo;howdy\u0026rdquo;. symbol. a data type whose instances are unique and immutable. and object\ndata type conversion javascript is a dynamically typed language:\nlet answer = 42; and later, you could assign the same variable a string value, for example:\nanswer = \u0026#39;thanks for all the fish!\u0026#39;; numbers and the \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; operator in expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, javascript converts numeric values to strings. for example:\nx = \u0026#39;the answer is \u0026#39; + 42 // \u0026#34;the answer is 42\u0026#34; y = 42 + \u0026#39; is the answer\u0026#39; // \u0026#34;42 is the answer\u0026#34; z = \u0026#39;37\u0026#39; + 7 // \u0026#34;377\u0026#34; with all other operators, javascript does not convert numeric values to strings. for example:\n\u0026#39;37\u0026#39; - 7 // 30 \u0026#39;37\u0026#39; * 7 // 259 converting strings to numbers in the case that a value representing a number is in memory as a string, there are methods for conversion.\nparseint() parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix. parsefloat() parses a string argument and returns a floating point number. parseint(\u0026#39;101\u0026#39;, 2) // 5 an alternative method of retrieving a number from a string is with the + (unary plus) operator:\n\u0026#39;1.1\u0026#39; + \u0026#39;1.1\u0026#39; // \u0026#39;1.11.1\u0026#39; (+\u0026#39;1.1\u0026#39;) + (+\u0026#39;1.1\u0026#39;) // 2.2 // note: the parentheses are added for clarity, not required. array the array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.\njavascript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (when those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.) javascript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form, e.g., num[1] or num['1']) as indexes. javascript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on and the last element is at the value of the array\u0026rsquo;s length property minus 1. javascript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (all standard built-in copy operations with any javascript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies). literals literals represent values in javascript. these are fixed values (not variables) that you literally provide in your script. this section describes the following types of literals:\narray literals boolean literals numeric literals object literals regexp literals string literals array literals an array literal is a list of zero or more expressions, each of which represents an array element, enclosed in square brackets ([]). when you create an array using an array literal, it is initialized with the specified values as its elements, and its length is set to the number of arguments specified.\nconst coffees = [\u0026#39;french roast\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;colombian\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;kona\u0026#39;]; // length is 3 extra commas in array literals if you put two commas in a row in an array literal, the array leaves an empty slot for the unspecified element.\nconst fish = [\u0026#39;lion\u0026#39;, , \u0026#39;angel\u0026#39;]; console.log(fish); // [ \u0026#39;lion\u0026#39;, \u0026lt;1 empty item\u0026gt;, \u0026#39;angel\u0026#39; ] index-accessing fish[1] returns undefined, but which is not exactly the same as the actual undefined value.\nin the following example, the length of the array is three. there is no mylist[3].\nconst mylist = [\u0026#39;home\u0026#39;, , \u0026#39;school\u0026#39;, ]; in the following example, the length of the array is four, and mylist[0] and mylist[2] are missing.\nconst mylist = [, \u0026#39;home\u0026#39;, , \u0026#39;school\u0026#39;]; in the following example, the length of the array is four, and mylist[1] and mylist[3] are missing. only the last comma is ignored.\nconst mylist = [\u0026#39;home\u0026#39;, , \u0026#39;school\u0026#39;, , ]; however, when writing your own code, you should explicitly declare the missing elements as undefined, or at least insert a comment to highlight its absence.\nconst mylist = [\u0026#39;home\u0026#39;, /* empty */, \u0026#39;school\u0026#39;, /* empty */, ]; boolean literals do not confuse the boolean primitive values true and false with the true and false values of the boolean object.\nany object, including a boolean object whose value is false, evaluates to true when passed to a conditional statement. for example, the condition in the following if statement evaluates to true:\nconst x = new boolean(false); if (x) { // this code is executed } this behavior does not apply to boolean primitive. for example, the condition in the following if statement evaluates to false:\nconst x = false; if (x) { // this code is not executed } do not use the boolean() constructor with new to convert a non-boolean value to a boolean value. use boolean as a function or a double not (!!) instead:\nconst good = boolean(expression); // use this const good2 = !!(expression); // or this const bad = new boolean(expression); // don\u0026#39;t use this! if you specify any object, including a boolean object whose value is false, as the initial value of a boolean object, the new boolean object has a value of true.\nconst myfalse = new boolean(false); // initial value of false const g = boolean(myfalse); // initial value of true const mystring = new string(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); // string object const s = boolean(mystring); // initial value of true numeric literals javascript numeric literals include integer literals in different bases as well as floating-point literals in base-10.\nnote that the language specification requires numeric literals to be unsigned. nevertheless, code fragments like -123.4 are fine, being interpreted as a unary - operator applied to the numeric literal 123.4.\ninteger literals integer and bigint literals can be written in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8) and binary (base 2).\na decimal integer literal is a sequence of digits without a leading 0 (zero). a leading 0 (zero) on an integer literal, or a leading 0o (or 0o) indicates it is in octal. octal integer literals can include only the digits 0 – 7. a leading 0x (or 0x) indicates a hexadecimal integer literal. hexadecimal integers can include digits (0 – 9) and the letters a – f and a – f. (the case of a character does not change its value. therefore: 0xa = 0xa = 10 and 0xf = 0xf = 15.) a leading 0b (or 0b) indicates a binary integer literal. binary integer literals can only include the digits 0 and 1. a trailing n suffix on an integer literal indicates a bigint literal. the integer literal can use any of the above bases. note that leading-zero octal syntax like 0123n is not allowed, but 0o123n is fine. some examples of integer literals are:\n0, 117, 123456789123456789n // decimal, base 10 015, 0001, 0o777777777777n // octal, base 8 0x1123, 0x00111, 0x123456789abcdefn // hexadecimal, \u0026#34;hex\u0026#34; or base 16 0b11, 0b0011, 0b11101001010101010101n // binary, base 2 floating-point literals succinctly, the syntax is:\n[digits].[digits][(e|e)[(+|-)]digits] for example:\n3.1415926 .123456789 3.1e+12 .1e-23 object literals an object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}).\nuse (.) to access string property name. use ([]) to access numeric property name. use ([]) to access unvalid identifier property name. for example the car object:\n// e.g. 1 const sales = \u0026#39;toyota\u0026#39;; function cartypes(name) { return name === \u0026#39;honda\u0026#39; ? name : `sorry, we don\u0026#39;t sell ${name}.`; } const car = { mycar: \u0026#39;saturn\u0026#39;, getcar: cartypes(\u0026#39;honda\u0026#39;), special: sales }; console.log(car.mycar); // saturn console.log(car.getcar); // honda console.log(car.special); // toyota // e.g. 2 const car = { manycars: { a: \u0026#39;saab\u0026#39;, b: \u0026#39;jeep\u0026#39; }, 7: \u0026#39;mazda\u0026#39; }; console.log(car.manycars.b); // jeep console.log(car[7]); // mazda // e.g. 3 const unusualpropertynames = { \u0026#39;\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;an empty string\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;bang!\u0026#39; } console.log(unusualpropertynames[\u0026#39;\u0026#39;]); // an empty string console.log(unusualpropertynames[\u0026#39;!\u0026#39;]); // bang! enhanced object literals object literals support a range of shorthand syntaxes that include setting the prototype at construction, shorthand for foo: foo assignments, defining methods, making super calls, and computing property names with expressions.\nconst obj = { // __proto__ __proto__: theprotoobj, // shorthand for \u0026#39;handler: handler\u0026#39; handler, // methods tostring() { // super calls return \u0026#39;d \u0026#39; + super.tostring(); }, // computed (dynamic) property names [\u0026#39;prop_\u0026#39; + (() =\u0026gt; 42)()]: 42, } regexp literals a regex literal is a pattern enclosed between slashes (/).\nconst re = /ab+c/; string literals a string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double (\u0026quot;) or single (') quotation marks.\n\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34; \u0026#39;1234\u0026#39; \u0026#39;one line \\n another line\u0026#39; \u0026#34;joyo\u0026#39;s cat\u0026#34; you should use string literals unless you specifically need to use a string object. see string for details on string objects.\nyou can call any of the string object\u0026rsquo;s methods on a string literal value. javascript automatically converts the string literal to a temporary string object, calls the method, then discards the temporary string object.\n// will print the number of symbols in the string including whitespace. console.log(\u0026#34;joyo\u0026#39;s cat\u0026#34;.length) // in this case, 10. template literals template literals are enclosed by the back-tick ( `).\n// basic literal string creation `in javascript \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39; is a line-feed.` // multiline strings `in javascript, template strings can run over multiple lines, but double and single quoted strings cannot.` // string interpolation const name = \u0026#39;lev\u0026#39;, time = \u0026#39;today\u0026#39;; `hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?` tagged templates tagged templates are a compact syntax for specifying a template literal along with a call to a tag function for parsing it. a tagged template is just a more succinct and semantic way to invoke a function that processes a string and a set of relevant values. the name of the template tag function precedes the template literal — as in the following example, where the template tag function is named print. the print function will interpolate the arguments and serialize any objects or arrays that may come up, avoiding the pesky [object object].\nconst formatarg = (arg) =\u0026gt; { if (array.isarray(arg)) { // print a bulleted list return arg.map((part) =\u0026gt; `- ${part}`).join(\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;); } if (arg.tostring === object.prototype.tostring) { // this object will be serialized to \u0026#34;[object object]\u0026#34;. // let\u0026#39;s print something nicer. return json.stringify(arg); } return arg; } const print = (segments, ...args) =\u0026gt; { // for any well-formed template literal, there will always be n args and // (n+1) string segments. let message = segments[0]; segments.slice(1).foreach((segment, index) =\u0026gt; { message += formatarg(args[index]) + segment; }); console.log(message); } const todos = [ \u0026#34;learn javascript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;learn web apis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;set up my website\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;profit!\u0026#34;, ]; const progress = { javascript: 20, html: 50, css: 10 }; print`i need to do: ${todos} my current progress is: ${progress} `; // i need to do: // - learn javascript // - learn web apis // - set up my website // - profit! // my current progress is: {\u0026#34;javascript\u0026#34;:20,\u0026#34;html\u0026#34;:50,\u0026#34;css\u0026#34;:10} since tagged template literals are just sugar of function calls, you can re-write the above as an equivalent function call:\nprint([\u0026#34;i need to do:\\n\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\\nmy current progress is: \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;], todos, progress); this may be reminiscent of the console.log-style interpolation:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;i need to do:\\n%o\\nmy current progress is: %o\\n\u0026#34;, todos, progress); tagged template reads more naturally than a traditional \u0026ldquo;formatter\u0026rdquo; function, where the variables and the template itself have to be declared separately.\nescape character character meaning \\0 null byte \\b backspace \\f form feed \\n new line \\r carriage return \\t tab \\v vertical tab \\' apostrophe or single quote \\\u0026quot; double quote \\\\ backslash character \\xxx the character with the latin-1 encoding specified by up to three octal digits xxx between 0 and 377. for example, \\251 is the octal sequence for the copyright symbol. \\xxx the character with the latin-1 encoding specified by the two hexadecimal digits xx between 00 and ff. for example, \\xa9 is the hexadecimal sequence for the copyright symbol. \\uxxxx the unicode character specified by the four hexadecimal digits xxxx. for example, \\u00a9 is the unicode sequence for the copyright symbol. \\u{xxxxx} unicode code point escapes. for example, \\u{2f804} is the same as the simple unicode escapes \\ud87e\\udc04. const quote = \u0026#34;\\\\ he read \\\u0026#34;the cremation of sam mcgee\\\u0026#34; by r.w. service. \\\\\u0026#34;; console.log(quote); // \\ he read \u0026#34;the cremation of sam mcgee\u0026#34; by r.w. service. \\ you can also escape line breaks by preceding them with backslash. the backslash and line break are both removed from the value of the string.\nconst str = \u0026#39;this string \\ is broken \\ across multiple \\ lines.\u0026#39; console.log(str); // this string is broken across multiple lines.

sigma_{xy} \u0026amp; sigma_{xz} \\ \\sigma_{yx} \u0026amp; sigma_{yy} \u0026amp; sigma_{yz} \\ \\sigma_{zx} \u0026amp; sigma_{zy} \u0026amp; sigma_{zz} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{ij}$ indicates that the stress component in the $i$-th coordinate direction is caused by the stress in the $j$-th coordinate direction. the symmetry of the stress tensor indicates the equilibrium of the forces, i.e., the sum of the tangential stresses in any plane is zero.\nin two dimensions, the stress tensor is represented by a $2\\times2$ symmetric matrix, and its components are denoted by $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$, $\\sigma_{xy}$, and $\\sigma_{yx}$.\nthe stress tensor in two dimensions can be written as:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{xx} \u0026amp; sigma_{xy} \\ \\sigma_{yx} \u0026amp; sigma_{yy} \\ \\end{bmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$ are the normal stresses acting on the $x$ and y planes, respectively, $\\sigma_{xy}$, and $\\sigma_{yx}$ is the shear stress acting on the $xy$ plane.\nthe stress tensor can be solved by applying an external force to an object and then measuring the stress inside the object. it is an important concept in the fields of elastodynamics, mechanics of materials, solid mechanics, and fluid mechanics. the stress tensor can also be used to calculate the strain tensor, which describes the deformation within a solid.\nstrain strain is the degree of deformation of an object under the action of an external force and is usually expressed as ε. strain can be divided into different types, including linear strain, shear strain, and volume strain, etc. each type of strain has different calculation formulae.\nlinear or axial strain linear strain refers to the degree of deformation of an object when it is stretched or compressed in a certain direction. the formula for calculating linear strain is\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta l}{l_{0}}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ represents the linear strain, $\\delta l$ represents the amount of change in the length of the object, and $l_{0}$ represents the original length of the object.\nshear strain shear strain is the degree of deformation that occurs when an object is subjected to a cutting force. the formula for calculating shear strain is\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\delta x}{h}$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the shear strain, $\\delta x$ is the displacement of the object shear, and $h$ is the thickness of the object shear surface.\nvolumetric strain volumetric strain is the degree of change in the overall volume of an object when subjected to an external force. the formula for calculating the volumetric strain is\n$$ \\epsilon_{v} = \\frac{\\delta v}{v_{0}}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{v}$ denotes the volume strain, $\\delta v$ denotes the amount of change in the volume of the object, and $v_{0}$ denotes the original volume of the object.\nthe appropriate strain formula needs to be selected for the calculation according to the specific type of strain and the deformation of the object. different types of strains have different importance and uses in different mechanical and engineering applications.\nstrain tensor strain tensor is a mathematical object that describes the deformation of a solid body in response to an applied stress. it is a second-order tensor, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.\nthe strain tensor is defined as the relative change in length between two infinitesimally close points within the body in response to an applied stress. it can be expressed as a matrix of six components in three dimensions, or as a vector in two dimensions.\nin three dimensions, the strain tensor can be represented as:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\begin{bmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} \u0026amp; epsilon_{xy} \u0026amp; epsilon_{xz} \\ \\epsilon_{yx} \u0026amp; epsilon_{yy} \u0026amp; epsilon_{yz} \\ \\epsilon_{zx} \u0026amp; epsilon_{zy} \u0026amp; epsilon_{zz} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{ij}$ represents the strain in the $i-th$ direction caused by a stress in the $j-th$ direction.\nin two dimensions, the strain tensor can be represented as: $$ \\epsilon = \\begin{bmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} \u0026amp;

plastic deformation elastic deformation refers to the reversible deformation of a material when subjected to stress. that is, when external forces are removed, the object can return to its original shape. elastic deformation typically occurs when the applied stress is below the elastic limit of the material.\nplastic deformation refers to the irreversible deformation of a material when subjected to stress. unlike elastic deformation, plastic deformation does not return to its original shape when the external forces are removed. plastic deformation typically occurs when the applied stress exceeds the elastic limit of the material. when a material is subjected to sufficiently large stresses, the atoms or molecules within it will begin to move and deform until they reach a new equilibrium position. this results in permanent changes to the shape and volume of the material.\nsmall strain linear elasticity small strain linear elasticity is a branch of continuum mechanics that deals with the behavior of materials under small deformations or strains. in this framework, it is assumed that the deformation is sufficiently small such that the relationship between stress and strain can be approximated as linear, meaning that the deformation is proportional to the applied stress and returns to its original shape when the stress is removed. this linear relationship is described by hooke\u0026rsquo;s law, which states that the stress is proportional to the strain.\nmathematically, this relationship can be expressed as $\\sigma = c \\epsilon$, where $\\sigma$ is the stress tensor, $\\epsilon$ is the strain tensor, and $c$ is the fourth-order elastic stiffness tensor. the stiffness tensor contains information about the material properties and can be determined experimentally or theoretically.\nthe small strain assumption means that the magnitude of the deformation is much smaller than the size of the object being deformed. this assumption allows for simplifications in mathematical computations and is valid for most engineering applications, including the design of structures and machines, the analysis of geological formations, and the development of new materials. it is an important tool for understanding the mechanical behavior of materials and predicting their response to external loads.\nelastic modulus (or young\u0026rsquo;s modulus) elastic modulus is a measure of the stiffness or elasticity of a material, usually denoted by the symbol $e$. elastic modulus is given by\n$$e = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}$$\nwhere e denotes the modulus of elasticity in pascals ($pa$) or kilopascals ($kpa$); $\\sigma$ denotes the stress in pascals; and $\\epsilon$ denotes the strain, unitless.\nelastic modulus is the ratio of the elastic deformation of a material to the area subjected to an external force. it is the ratio of the degree of elastic deformation produced by a material when subjected to an external force to the area subjected to the force, and can also be expressed as the amount of elastic energy stored per unit volume. the higher the modulus of elasticity, the more difficult it is for the material to deform or distort, and the higher the stiffness.\nelastic modulus is commonly used to describe the elastic properties of various materials, including solids, liquids and gases. in solid materials, the modulus of elasticity can be used to calculate the relationship between stress and strain when a material is subjected to a force. it is an important parameter for the elastic behavior of materials and is of great importance for engineering design and material selection.\nelastic modulus of different materials can vary greatly, for example, the modulus of elasticity of steel is about $2.1\\times10^{11} pa$, the modulus of elasticity of aluminum is about $7\\times10^{10} pa$, and the modulus of elasticity of rubber is only about a few million $pa$.\nelastic modulus can be measured by various experimental methods, such as tensile test, compression test and bending test. in engineering design, elastic modulus is often used to calculate and predict the deformation and damage behavior of materials under different loads to ensure that the designed structures and materials will meet the expected usage requirements.\nstrain energy density strain energy density is a measure of the amount of energy stored within a material per unit volume due to its deformation or strain. when a material is subjected to external forces, it undergoes deformation, and some of the energy of the system is stored within the material in the form of strain energy.\nthe strain energy density is represented by the symbol $u$ (sometimes also denoted by $w$) and is typically expressed in units of joules per cubic meter ($j/m^{3}$). it is calculated by dividing the strain energy of a material by its volume. the equation for the strain energy density is\n$$u = \\frac{1}{2} \\times σ \\times ε = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (e \\times \\epsilon^{2}) $$\nσ denotes the stress in pascals ($pa$); and $\\epsilon$ denotes the strain, unitless, and $e$ denotes the modulus of elasticity of the object. the $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the formula is because the elastic potential energy is generated by the deformation in both directions, tensile and compressive, which are equal and therefore need to be averaged.\nstrain energy density plays an important role in determining the mechanical properties of materials, such as their stiffness, strength, and toughness. it is often used in engineering applications to design and analyze the behavior of materials under different loading conditions.\nfor example, in the design of a spring, the strain energy density is a key factor in determining the amount of deformation that the spring can undergo before reaching its maximum load capacity. by calculating the strain energy density, engineers can optimize the design of the spring to achieve the desired level of performance and reliability.\ndifferents between elastic modulus and strain energy density elastic modulus and strain energy density are both important parameters in the mechanics of materials, but they describe different material properties.\nelastic modulus (also known as the coefficient of elasticity) is a measure of the stiffness or elasticity of a material and is usually denoted by the symbol e. it is the ratio of the degree of elastic deformation produced by a material when subjected to an external force to the area subjected to the force, and can also be expressed as the amount of elastic energy stored per unit volume. the greater the modulus of elasticity, the more difficult it is for the material to deform or distort, and the higher the stiffness. the unit of modulus of elasticity is pascal ($pa$) or kilopascal ($kpa$).\nstrain energy density is the density of energy stored in the material during deformation, usually expressed by the symbol u. it is the ratio of strain energy to volume of the material in joules per cubic meter ($j/m^{3}$). when a material is subjected to an external force, it deforms and this deformation stores energy, which is recovered in the form of strain energy density to describe the process when the external force stops acting on the material. strain energy density can be used to predict properties such as stability and strength of a material during deformation.\nalthough both elastic modulus and strain energy density describe the mechanical properties of a material, they describe slightly different aspects. elastic modulus is more concerned with the stiffness and elastic properties of a material, while strain energy density is more concerned with the energy storage and release properties of a material.\nlamé parameters lamé parameters, also known as lamé coefficients, are two material constants that describe the elastic properties of a solid material. they are named after the french mathematician gabriel lamé who introduced them in the mid-19th century.\nthe two lamé parameters are denoted by $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, where $\\lambda$ is the first lamé parameter (also known as the \u0026ldquo;lamé constant\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;lamé modulus\u0026rdquo;) and $\\mu$ is the second lamé parameter (also known as the \u0026ldquo;shear modulus\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;rigidity modulus\u0026rdquo;).\nin terms of these parameters, the stress tensor can be expressed as a function of the strain tensor using the linear elasticity equations. specifically, for a linear elastic material, the stress tensor $\\sigma$ is related to the strain tensor $\\epsilon$ by the equation:\n$$\\sigma = \\lambda tr(\\epsilon) i + 2\\mu\\epsilon$$\nwhere $tr(\\epsilon)$ is the trace of the strain tensor (the sum of its diagonal elements), $i$ is the identity matrix, and $\\epsilon$ is the strain tensor.\nthe lamé parameters are important in the study of elasticity, plasticity, and deformation of solids, and are used to characterize the mechanical behavior of materials under various loading conditions. they are typically determined experimentally and can vary significantly depending on the material composition and structure.\n","date":"0001-01-01","permalink":"https://kkkiona.github.io/posts/theory/theory-of-elasticity/theory-of-elasticity-note-1/","summary":"Stress Stress is the distribution of internal forces per unit area within a material, usually represented by the symbol $\\sigma$.

compliance minimization with density filtering and a volume constraint is a problem commonly encountered in structural optimization. the goal is to design a structure that is both strong enough to withstand its intended loads and lightweight, to minimize material usage and cost.\ndensity filtering is a technique used to remove low-density elements from the design domain. the idea is to exclude regions with low material density that are unlikely to contribute significantly to the structural stiffness. this can help to reduce the overall weight of the structure.\nvolume constraint, on the other hand, places a limit on the total amount of material used in the design. this can be expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the structure or as a maximum allowable mass. the volume constraint ensures that the optimization process results in a design that is physically feasible and does not exceed the available resources.\nthe compliance minimization objective is to minimize the deformation or strain energy of the structure subject to the loads and boundary conditions. this objective function captures the overall stiffness of the structure, which is a key performance criterion for many engineering applications.\nto solve this problem, various optimization techniques can be used, including gradient-based methods, evolutionary algorithms, and topology optimization methods. these methods can be combined with density filtering and volume constraints to generate designs that meet the desired specifications.\nin summary, compliance minimization with density filtering and a volume constraint is a common problem in structural optimization that aims to design a lightweight and strong structure. the problem can be solved using various optimization techniques, including density filtering and volume constraints, to generate designs that meet the desired performance criteria while satisfying physical constraints.\nnon-physical phenomena \u0026amp; chequer-boarding non-physical phenomena refers to the phenomena or effects that are not determined by physical factors when simulating or describing a physical system. these phenomena or effects are usually caused by numerical or algorithmic issues of the simulation or description method itself.\nchequer-boarding is a type of non-physical phenomenon that often occurs in computational fluid dynamics (cfd). it refers to the alternating high and low pressure regions appearing on the mesh points in the simulated flow field, which can be metaphorically compared to the black and white squares on a checkerboard. this phenomenon is typically caused by the instability and inappropriate mesh partition of numerical methods, resulting in the inaccuracy and unreliability of the simulation results.\nto avoid non-physical phenomena like chequer-boarding, some improvements in numerical methods and mesh partition are usually required. for example, higher-order accuracy numerical methods, improved discretization schemes, finer mesh partition, and some smoothing techniques can be adopted to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the flow field simulation.\ndensity filtering is a commonly used technique in topology optimization that can partially address non-physical phenomena such as chequer-boarding. density filtering can be understood as a smoothing operation on the design domain during the optimization process, which removes some geometric features that are unreasonable and produces a more rational design. in some cases, density filtering can reduce the occurrence of chequer-boarding by suppressing high-frequency oscillations.\ndensity filtering usually involves the concept of a filtering radius, which means that for a given element to be optimized, the density values of the neighboring elements within a certain radius are averaged to obtain the new density value of the element. by continually applying this smoothing operation, a smoother density distribution can be obtained, avoiding the appearance of some unreasonable geometric features. at the same time, due to the smoothing effect of this processing method, some high-frequency oscillations are also eliminated or weakened, thereby achieving the goal of reducing chequer-boarding.\nit should be noted that the application of density filtering needs to be performed under appropriate circumstances, as excessive smoothing can also have adverse effects on optimization results. therefore, in practical applications, the specific parameters and usage of density filtering need to be determined by considering factors such as optimization efficiency and computational efficiency.\nstiffness interpolation stiffness interpolation refers to a technique in finite element analysis where the stiffness matrix of an element is calculated based on the properties of its constituent materials. in stiffness interpolation, the element\u0026rsquo;s stiffness matrix is represented as a linear combination of the stiffness matrices of the constituent materials, weighted by their volume fractions within the element.\nstiffness interpolation is used in multiscale and multiphysics simulations, where the properties of materials may vary across different length scales or under different loading conditions. by using stiffness interpolation, the properties of each material within an element can be taken into account when calculating the overall stiffness matrix of the element. this allows for more accurate simulations of complex structures and materials.\none common approach for stiffness interpolation is the voigt-reuss-hill (vrh) method, which represents the overall stiffness matrix of an element as the arithmetic or geometric mean of the stiffness matrices of its constituent materials. other methods, such as the mori-tanaka method and the self-consistent method, may also be used depending on the specific requirements of the simulation.\nsolid isotropic material penalisation (simp) solid isotropic material penalisation (simp) is a numerical method commonly used in structural optimization. the basic idea is to use material density as the optimization variable to find the optimal material distribution that satisfies the given performance indicators and constraints.\nin the simp method, the structure is divided into many small elements, and each element is assigned a material density that varies continuously between 0 and 1. during the optimization process, the optimization algorithm adjusts the density of each element to achieve the best structural performance. the simp method typically uses penalty functions to restrict the range of material densities between $0$ and $1$, thus constraining the material density. therefore, a penalty function is needed to constrain the range of material density to avoid non-physical material density distributions.\none common penalty function is the power law function, which is typically written as: $$ \\rho^{p} $$\nhere, $\\rho$ represents material density, and $p$ is a positive real number. when $p$ is larger, the penalty function has a more significant effect. this penalty function can constrain the values of material density between $0$ and $1$, avoiding non-physical material density distributions and improving the reliability of the optimization results.\nthe simp method also uses the equivalent young\u0026rsquo;s modulus to represent the stiffness of the material. the equivalent young\u0026rsquo;s modulus is a function of density that represents the effect of material density on stiffness. typically, the equivalent young\u0026rsquo;s modulus increases as material density increases, as higher density materials have higher stiffness.\nduring the optimization process, the simp method calculates the equivalent young\u0026rsquo;s modulus of the material and uses it to calculate the stiffness matrix of the entire structure. by considering the equivalent young\u0026rsquo;s modulus of the material, the simp method can automatically consider the effect of the material\u0026rsquo;s topology on the stiffness of the structure.\none important application of the simp method is to achieve lightweight design in structural design. by using the simp method, the optimal material distribution can be found to minimize the total mass of the structure while satisfying the given performance indicators and constraints. the simp method has been widely used in structural optimization in aerospace, automotive, and mechanical engineering, and has been widely applied in material design.\noptimality criteria (oc) optimality criteria (oc) method is a popular approach used in structural optimization for solving problems related to minimization of the weight or maximization of the stiffness of a structure subjected to certain constraints. in this method, the structure is discretized into finite elements, and the design variables are associated with the properties of these elements.\nthe oc method is based on the assumption that the optimal solution is achieved when certain optimality criteria are satisfied. these criteria are formulated as a set of nonlinear equations that are solved iteratively to obtain the optimal solution. the basic idea of the oc method is to reduce the compliance of the structure by modifying the properties of the finite elements in such a way that the optimality criteria are satisfied.\nthe oc method has several advantages, such as its simplicity and ability to handle problems with large numbers of design variables. however, it also has some limitations, such as its reliance on heuristics and the lack of a formal convergence analysis.\nin recent years, several variations of the oc method have been proposed, such as the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (beso) and the extended optimality criteria (eoc) method, which aim to overcome some of the limitations of the traditional oc method.\nlinear system linear system refers to a system of linear equations, where each equation is linear in its variables. in other words, the variables are raised only to the power of 1 and multiplied by constants. a linear system can be represented in matrix form as $ax = b$, where a is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants. linear systems are commonly used in many fields, such as engineering, physics, economics, and computer science. they can be solved using various methods, such as gaussian elimination, lu decomposition, and matrix inversion.\nmatrix-free operator matrix-free operator refers to a method for performing matrix-vector multiplication in which the explicit construction of the matrix is not required. instead, the operator is defined by a set of algorithms or functions that compute the result of multiplying a given vector by the matrix without explicitly forming the matrix. this approach can be useful for large-scale problems where the storage and computation requirements of the matrix are prohibitive. instead, only the necessary information to perform the matrix-vector multiplication is stored, leading to more efficient computations.\naassembly of coarse operators aassembly of coarse operators is a fundamental step in the construction of multigrid methods, which are numerical algorithms used to solve large systems of equations arising from partial differential equations (pdes). in particular, coarse operators play a crucial role in the process of transferring information between different levels of resolution within a multigrid hierarchy.\nthe assembly of coarse operators involves constructing a matrix that approximates the behavior of the fine-scale operator on a given coarse grid. this coarse operator matrix can then be used to solve the system of equations on the coarse grid more efficiently than solving the full system directly.\nthe construction of the coarse operator matrix typically involves two main steps: restriction and interpolation. the restriction step involves reducing the solution and right-hand sides of the fine-scale system to their corresponding counterparts on the coarse grid, while the interpolation step involves mapping the coarse-grid solution back to the fine grid. these steps require careful consideration of the underlying pde and the chosen discretization scheme.\nin summary, the assembly of coarse operators is a key component of multigrid methods for solving pdes. it involves constructing a matrix that approximates the behavior of the fine-scale operator on a given coarse grid, using a combination of restriction and interpolation operations.\n","date":"0001-01-01","permalink":"https://kkkiona.github.io/posts/theory/topology-optimization/topology-optimization-note-1/","summary":"Compliance minimization \u0026amp; Density
